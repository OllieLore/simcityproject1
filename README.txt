To know:
Make sure the config and region files are in the same folder as the project! We have included test.txt and test.csv for demo purposes.

To compile and run:
1. g++ *.cpp
2. ./a.out

**Note: the program will not immediately prompt for a input file, so you will see nothing upon executing. Simply type the config fileto get the simulation started.
